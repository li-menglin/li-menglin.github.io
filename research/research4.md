      <ul>
        <li>Developed end-to-end ML pipelines for large-scale cellular network datasets, implementing feature engineering, normalization, and PyTorch-based data loaders to enable reproducible model training and evaluation.</li>
        <li>Trained and optimized a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) by refining network architecture, tuning hyperparameters, and improving training stability to enhance representation quality.</li>
        <li>Extracted and analyzed discrete latent embeddings from the VQ-VAE, applying clustering metrics and quantization analysis to identify prototypical traffic patterns and improve interpretability of learned representations.</li>
        <li>Surveyed spatio-temporal ML models (Transformers, Graph Neural Networks) and evaluated their applicability to traffic prediction and adaptive scheduling tasks in multi-beam wireless systems.</li>
