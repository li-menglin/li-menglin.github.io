Menglin LI is currently a bachelor’s student in Physics (with Electronics and Information Science minor) at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). My research intterests lie in the “intersection” area of physics and information science, especially in healthcare applications (e.g. biomedical signal processing, sensor technologies in healthcare). 

Solid theoretical background with GPA over 3.6/4.0. Various major scholarship and competition winner. A voracious learner and passionate researcher with abundant research experiences. Now looking for a Ph.D. opening in 2026 Fall.
