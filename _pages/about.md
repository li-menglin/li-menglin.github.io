    I am currently a bachelor’s student in Physics (with Electronics and Information Science minor) 
    at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). My research interests lie in the intersection of physics and 
    information science, especially in healthcare applications (e.g. biomedical signal processing, 
    sensor technologies in healthcare).

    FMCW Millimeter-Wave Radar for Non-Contact Cardiopulmonary Monitoring 
Advised by Prof. XXX, SYSU                            Research Assistant                                          11/2024 to now
•	Configured Texas Instruments IWR1443BOOST Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with mmWave Studio to acquire raw radar echoes for non-contact cardiopulmonary monitoring experiments.
•	Implemented approximated Fast Fourier Transform (apFFT) to resolve range profiles of radar chirps.
•	Designed advanced preprocessing modules including smoothing-spline fitting and matched filtering, and applied Variational Mode Extraction (VME) to decompose respiration and heartbeat components under noisy conditions.
•	Applied double Chirp-Z Transform (double-CZT) for high-resolution spectral estimation of both respiratory and cardiac signals.
•	Reproduced and validated published benchmark results within MATLAB, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the proposed FMCW radar framework for non-contact vital signs detection.
Experimental Research on SiPM-Based Cosmic-Ray and Neutron Detection Systems 
Advised by Prof. XXX, SYSU                            Research Assistant                                          10/2024 to now
•	Designed and developed a detection platform using plastic scintillators coupled with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) 
•	Optimized SiPM operation parameters, including bias voltage and threshold settings, to enhance detector resolution, reduce background noise, and achieve reliable muon flux measurements across multiple structural levels.
•	Applied the Bethe–Bloch equation and Landau MPV, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation in Python to model muon energy-loss spectra and predict counting rates
•	Conducted neutron detection experiments using Am-241 α particles on aluminum foils as a neutron source, identifying the p–t coincidence peak with a He-3 detector and quantifying its energy through calibrated multi-channel spectral analysis.
Machine Learning for Beam-Space Traffic Pattern Analysis
Advised by Prof. XXX, The Chinese University of Hong Kong     Research Assistant    10/2024 to 06/2025
•	Developed end-to-end ML pipelines for large-scale cellular network datasets, implementing feature engineering, normalization, and PyTorch-based data loaders to enable reproducible model training and evaluation.
•	Trained and optimized a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) by refining network architecture, tuning hyperparameters, and improving training stability to enhance representation quality.
•	Extracted and analyzed discrete latent embeddings from the VQ-VAE, applying clustering metrics and quantization analysis to identify prototypical traffic patterns and improve interpretability of learned representations.
•	Surveyed spatio-temporal ML models (Transformers, Graph Neural Networks) and evaluated their applicability to traffic prediction and adaptive scheduling tasks in multi-beam wireless systems.
