<ul>
  <li>Designed and developed a detection platform using plastic scintillators coupled with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs).</li>
  <li>Optimized SiPM operation parameters, including bias voltage and threshold settings, to enhance detector resolution, reduce background noise, and achieve reliable muon flux measurements across multiple structural levels.</li>
  <li>Applied the Bethe–Bloch equation and Landau MPV, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation in Python to model muon energy-loss spectra and predict counting rates.</li>
  <li>Conducted neutron detection experiments using Am-241 α particles on aluminum foils as a neutron source, identifying the p–t coincidence peak with a He-3 detector and quantifying its energy through calibrated multi-channel spectral analysis.</li>
</ul>
