      <ul>
        <li>Designed and developed a detection platform using plastic scintillators coupled with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs).</li>
        <li>Optimized SiPM parameters (bias voltage, thresholds) to enhance resolution and reduce background noise for reliable muon flux measurements.</li>
        <li>Applied Bethe–Bloch equation and Landau MPV, implemented Monte Carlo simulation in Python to model muon energy-loss spectra.</li>
        <li>Conducted neutron detection with Am-241 α source and He-3 detector, identifying p–t coincidence peaks through calibrated multi-channel spectral analysis.</li>
