I am currently a bachelor’s student in Physics (with Electronics and Information Science minor) at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). My research intterests lie in the “intersection” area of physics and information science, especially in healthcare applications (e.g. biomedical signal processing, sensor technologies in healthcare). 


**research interests**

- Radar Technologies in Healthcare 
- Biomedical Signal Processing
- Optoelectronic Devices (e.g. SiPMs)
- Silicon Photonics
