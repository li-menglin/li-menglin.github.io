      <ul>
        <li>Configured Texas Instruments IWR1443BOOST Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with mmWave Studio to acquire raw radar echoes for non-contact cardiopulmonary monitoring experiments.</li>
        <li>Implemented approximated Fast Fourier Transform (apFFT) to resolve range profiles of radar chirps.</li>
        <li>Designed advanced preprocessing modules including smoothing-spline fitting and matched filtering, and applied Variational Mode Extraction (VME) to decompose respiration and heartbeat components under noisy conditions.</li>
        <li>Applied double Chirp-Z Transform (double-CZT) for high-resolution spectral estimation of both respiratory and cardiac signals.</li>
        <li>Reproduced and validated published benchmark results within MATLAB, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the proposed FMCW radar framework for non-contact vital signs detection.</li>
