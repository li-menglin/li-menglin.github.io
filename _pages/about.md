  <h2 class="page__title">Biography</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a bachelor’s student in Physics, with a minor in Electronics and Information Science, at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). My research interests 
    lie in the intersection area of physics and information science, especially in healthcare applications such as biomedical signal processing and sensor
    technologies in healthcare. I have a solid theoretical background with a GPA over 3.6/4.0, and I am a winner of various major scholarships and competitions. 
    To summarize, I consider myself as a voracious learner and passionate researcher with abundant research experiences. Now I am looking for a Ph.D. opening in 
    Fall 2026.
