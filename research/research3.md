<ul>
  <li>Conducted a critical review of the CHARM fixed-target experiment (400 GeV proton–copper collisions), examining its methodology and exclusion bounds on long-lived particles (LLPs) to establish a benchmark for subsequent studies.</li>
  <li>Utilized the Pythia8 event generator to simulate proton–proton collisions at LHC energies, producing LLP kinematic spectra and decay-length distributions under benchmark BSM scenarios.</li>
  <li>Investigated the geometry and shielding of the proposed CODEX-b far detector at LHCb, assessing its acceptance for LLP decays within the 10×10×10 m³ fiducial volume and evaluating its potential to extend sensitivity beyond existing experiments.</li>
  <li>Applied Monte Carlo methods to compute spatial decay distributions and, in collaboration with colleagues employing Geant4 for detector response, derived sensitivity curves for models including dark photons and axion-like particles (ALPs), demonstrating CODEX-b's complementary reach in the LLP parameter space.</li>
</ul>
